# GifTastic
GifTastic fun with ajax and the giphy api

# Overview
This project is a fun way to search for gifs when you need the perfect response to your coworker's email or IM.  

The app comes with pre-loaded topics but users can also add additional search phrases.  When the user clicks a search topic, 10 gifs are returned and displayed to the user.  Users are able to click on the gif to see it animate or click again to pause the image.  If the user clicks the same topic again, 10 new gifs are added to the page. 

The project uses bootstrap, giphy's open api, and jquery.
